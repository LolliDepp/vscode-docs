# November 2017 (version 1.19)

## Insiders Release

Welcome to the Insiders build. These are the preliminary notes for the November 1.19 release of Visual Studio Code. As we get closer to the release date, you'll see details below about new features and important fixes.

Until the November release notes are available, you can still track our progress:

* **[Commit Log](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/commits/master)** - GitHub commits to the vscode open source repository.
* **[Closed issues](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/milestone/54?closed=1)** - Resolved bugs and implemented feature requests in the November milestone.

We really appreciate people taking a look at our new features as soon as they are ready so check back here often and learn what's new to try out.

If you find issues or have suggestions, you can enter them in the VS Code repository on [GitHub](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues).

## Workbench

### Pipe output directly into VS Code

We added support to pipe the output of a command directly into VS Code and have it open in an editor:

![Pipe Output](images/1_19/stdin.gif)

**Note:** The terminal command will wait until the editor is closed to make sure that all output is piped into the editor, even if it is received after the editor was already opened. This is the equivalent of running with `--wait`.

### New editor tabs layout option

A new setting, `workbench.editor.tabSizing`, was added to control how tabs should size depending on the space available in the outer container. The default (`fit`) works as before and will always ensure that the tab shows the entire name of the file. If space gets too little, a scroll bar will appear.

You can change this behavior by setting this new option to `shrink`. When space is little, tabs will shrink up to a minimum and thus make it less likely that a scroll bar appears.

### Compare file to Clipboard

You can now compare the contents of the currently opened file with the contents of the Clipboard. The command is **Compare Active File with Clipboard** (command id `workbench.files.action.compareWithClipboard`).

## New commands

Key|Command|Command id
---|-------|----------
`kb(workbench.action.openRawDefaultSettings)`|Open Raw Default Settings|`workbench.action.openRawDefaultSettings`
`kb(workbench.action.toggleTabsVisibility)`|View: Toggle Tab Visibility|`workbench.action.toggleTabsVisibility`
`kb(workbench.action.lastEditorInGroup)`|View: Open Last Editor in Group|`workbench.action.lastEditorInGroup`
`kb(workbench.files.action.compareWithClipboard)`|Compare Active File with Clipboard|`workbench.files.action.compareWithClipboard`
